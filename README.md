# What you should do to run this app

 1. Run couple commands `yarn` in folder `server` and `mobile` to install packages.
 2. Open mobile folder and write `yarn web` in terminal.
 3. Then open folder server and write `yarn server` in terminal. 
 4. Also you should have your own mongoDB, you can add it in folder `server/config` file `default.json`, `mongoURI`
